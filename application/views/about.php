<h2>About Localeaks</h2>
<div class="info"><p>
One key component of journalism in a democracy is the anonymous drop box. A working democracy must include the ability of sources to initiate and fuel the journalistic process with confidence of anonymity.
</p>
<p>
At localeaks.com, we are giving citizens the ability to submit news tips to over 1400 U.S.  news organizations through one simple form. We are also offering U.S. News organizations on the local and state levels the ability to implement their own version.
</p>
<p>
Each drop box consists of a secure web connection and form that immediately encrypts both files and text submitted and removes identifying metadata from documents.
</p>
<p>
The system also makes every effort to leave no traceable remnants from the transaction, such as identifiable session cookies on the client side, or logging of any IP addresses on the server side.
</p>
<p>
Those interested in hosting their own version of the software can inquire at hosting@localeaks.com
